Hi! This is an encounter difficulty calculator for D&D 5ed. written in Go with usage of [Webview Library](https://github.com/webview/webview). Current app verison is 1.0.0.

# Installation
Currently, there is only Windows version provided to download from releases section. It is built for windows-amd64 config.

## Windows installation
Download the .zip file attached to latest release. You will find three files there - the .exe application and two .dll libraries, required for app to work.

Extract all the three files into the same folder, and run the .exe. It should work!

You may also move the .dll files into **C:\Windows\System32** directory (administrative privileges required). Then you will be able to run the .exe from anywhere on the computer (required .dlls are loaded from PATH variable).

## Linux/Darwin (macOS) installation
There are no ready files for these systems. You may try to build the application by yourself.

You need to clone this repository, have the Go language installed on computer and run `go build`. You need to compile it with CGO enabled. I do not guarantee, that everything will work well on these systems.

# You found bug? Have an idea?
