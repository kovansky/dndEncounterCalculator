# Installation

Download the .zip file attached to latest release. You will find three files there - the .exe application and two .dll libraries, required for app to work.

Extract all the three files into the same folder, and run the .exe. It should work!

You may also move the .dll files into **C:\Windows\System32** directory (administrative privileges required). Then you will be able to run the .exe from anywhere on the computer (required .dlls are loaded from PATH variable).
